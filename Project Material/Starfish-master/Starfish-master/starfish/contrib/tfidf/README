Introduction
------------
The TF–IDF weight (Term Frequency–Inverse Document Frequency) is a weight 
often used in information retrieval and text mining. 
This weight is a statistical measure used to evaluate how important a word 
is to a document in a collection or corpus. 
For details, please visit: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tf%E2%80%93idf

TF-IDF is implemented as a pipeline of 3 MapReduce jobs:
  - Part 1: implements the “Job 1: Word Frequency in Doc”;
  - Part 2: implements the “Job 2: Word Counts For Docs”;
  - Part 3: implements the “Job 3: Docs In Corpus and computes TF-IDF”.


Job Execution
-------------
The script run_tfidf.sh can be used to perform TF-IDF as a sequence 
of 3 MapReduce jobs.

Usage:
   ./run_tfidf.sh <input_dir> <output_dir> [conf]
 
   where:
      input_dir  = HDFS Directory with the input files
      output_dir = HDFS Directory to place the output
      conf       = Optional hadoop configuration options

This script will create three directories under <output_dir>, namely,
tfidf1, tfidf2, and tfidf3, to place to output from each MR job.

Examples:
   ./run_tfidf.sh ~/input ~/output "-conf=myconf.xml"
   ./run_tfidf.sh ~/input ~/output "-Dmapred.reduce.tasks=2"
