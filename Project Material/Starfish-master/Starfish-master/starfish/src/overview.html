<p>
Starfish is a self-tuning system for big data analytics.
Starfish builds on Hadoop while adapting to user needs and system 
workloads to provide good performance automatically, without any 
need for users to understand and manipulate the
many tuning knobs in Hadoop.
</p>

<p>
The novelty in Starfish's approach comes from how it focuses
simultaneously on different workload granularities---overall workload, 
workflows, and jobs (procedural and declarative)---as well as across 
various decision points---provisioning, optimization, scheduling,
and data layout. This approach enables Starfish to handle the 
significant interactions arising among choices made at different levels.
