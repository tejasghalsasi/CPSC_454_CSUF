Project: Starfish Visualizer
Authors: Herodotos Herodotou, Fei Dong, Nick Bodnar
Date:    April 4, 2010

Description
-----------
Provides a Graphical User Interface for performing:
(a) Job Analysis - analyzing the execution of a MapReduce job on a Hadoop cluster
(b) What-if Analysis - asking what-if questions about how the configuration
       settings, cluster resources, and input data properties can impact
       the performance of a MapReduce job
(c) Job Optimization - finding the optimal configuration settings with which
       to execute a MapReduce job on a Hadoop cluster


Installation
------------
1. Install JavaFX 1.2.1, NOT the latest version
   (http://javafx.com/downloads/all.jsp)
2. Create an environment variable called JAVAFX_HOME that contains
   the installation directory of JavaFX.
  

Compilation
-----------
The build.xml file contains the commands for compiling the project using "ant".
Useful commands:
  'ant'       -> Builds the entire project and creates starfish-visualizer.jar
  'ant run'   -> Executes
  'ant clean' -> Deletes the build directory and starfish-visualizer.jar


Execution
---------
You can execute the visualizer in two ways:
1. Use 'ant run'
2. Use '$JAVAFX_HOME/bin/javafx -jar starfish-visualizer.jar'

The visualizer expects as input a directory with the following
directory structure:
- history: contains the Hadoop-generated conf and history files (required)
- job_profiles: contains job profiles created by the Profiler or 
                adjusted profiles (optional)
- task_profiles: contains the raw task profiles collected by the 
                 Profiler (optional)
- transfers: contains transfer information collected by the Profiler (optional)


Development with Eclipse
------------------------
1. Install the JavaFX plugin from http://javafx.com/downloads/eclipse-plugin/
2. Copy the .classpath and .project files from the "visualizer/.eclipse.templates" 
   directory into the "visualizer" directory
3. In Eclipse, go to "File->New...->JavaFX Project", select "Create project
   from existing source", select the "visualizer/" directory, and click "Next"
    (if using Eclipse 3.6 Helios, select "File > Import > Existing projects into workspace")
4. Use the "Link additional source" option (or right click project name, select "Build Path -> Link Source...") to link the following directories:
   - Starfish/starfish/src/profile
   - Starfish/starfish/src/whatif
   - Starfish/starfish/src/job_opt
